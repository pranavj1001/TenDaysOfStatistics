We define E to be the event in which the sum rolled by two evenly-weighted dice is > 9.

The set of outcomes satisfying E is: {(4,6) (6,4) (5,5) (6,5) (5,6) (6,6)}.
We can use this to find: P(E) = |E|/|S| = 6/36 = 1/6

We want to find the probability of sum being <= 9. 
Because we have P(E) and we know that the probability we want comprises the rest of the sample space, 
we calculate it as follows: 1 - P(E) = 1 - (1/6) = 5/6.
