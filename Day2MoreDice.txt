We define E to be the event satisfying the following conditions:

    1.The values rolled by both dice are different.
    2.The sum of the values rolled is 6.

The set of outcomes satisfying E is:{(1,5),(2,4),(4,2),(5,1)}. We also know that |S| (the size of the sample space) is 36, because there are 6 possible rolls per die and we have 2 dice (6^2 = 36) We can use this to find:

	P(E) = |E|/|S| = 4/36 = 1/9
