Our bag starts out 3 with red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn (without replacement) from the bag. We must assume that the first marble to be drawn is red, then find the probability that the second marble is blue. Note that we are not looking for the probability that both events occur, we are only looking for the probability that the second event occurs in a given state.

After 1 red marble is drawn, there will be 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles in the bag. So, in the bag's current state, there is a 2/6 probability of drawing a red marble and a 4/6 probability of drawing a blue marble. Because our goal is to find the probability of drawing a blue marble, our answer is 4/6 (which reduces to 2/3).
